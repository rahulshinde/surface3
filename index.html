			. opening scene (narrow hallway)

			C O N T A I N E R
			
			room is deeper than it is wide
			
			constructed from 4 planes, open ceiling for texture, open entrance for camera. 
			
			wall directly in front of camera has cutout for door.
			all “walls” constructed using planes with an unspecified thickness, 
			all constructed with black fill and white outline
			windows will be created based on needs of the models being placed into space.

					occupies 3 walls
					bottom + right + back
					i think these will all be textures that should be devised based on a visual relationship devised from the physical 	position of the voyeur.
			
				⁃	bottom: internal to the character (defying logic / natural order that is observable externally ! a product of the unconscious ! )
				⁃	right: the character, augmented through a screen
				⁃	back: the character, viewed physically

			camera positioned to the left of container, 
			side: camera-entrance
			outside of left wall visible, along with texture used for faux roof above container, along with whatever exists outside the container.
			
			camera pans to the right along x axis (fixed)
				text flashes on screen (on the surface of screen): 
				( lines of text displayed in sequence, not concurrently )
				welcome home 
				to your 
				welcome to your 
				you are home
				1. allow yourself to become comfortable
			
			panning stops once camera is centered on camera side plane (position 1)
			
			brief pause-
			
			camera begins to slowly enter space along z axis (fixed)
			as the camera approaches extrusion containing animation 1 it starts to pan to the right
			camera begins to enter extrusion containing animation 1
			once the camera has reached the center of the room, begin panning left
			as soon as left wall of extrusion containing animation 2 is visible begin fast cut 1 (addressing the screen)
			camera is re-set to position 1
			
			camera camera begins to slowly enter space along z axis approaching animation 3, mirror, and object
			as text from animation 2 comes into view begin fast cut 2
			end with shot of camera facing mirror.
			
			2. middle (elongated bedroom)
			
			C O N T A I N E R
			
			the room takes the appearance of an upper case ‘L’ closest to the door on the bottom left corner of the room is a bed. underneath the bed, a void has formed. the very top of the room is illuminated by a light with an external source. close to the top left of the room, a hallway is concealed, the only hint of it;s presence come from the faint glow it emits.

			camera begins at bottom right of room facing the bed, angled down so the animation under the bed is in view

				derivative no. 1, extracted from a pre-recorded 
				sequence, inverted from a repetitive pulse.
			
				2. an underlying assumption
			
			camera begins to enter room, keep focus on one point of the video playing under the bed
			as the camera aproaches the corner begin a slight turn to the right so it eventually faces the top of the room (facing animation )
			as the camera begins to face perpendicular to animation 2 fastcut 1 begins
			
			camera continues to approach window playing animation 2
			scene ends right after extrusion at top left of room begins to come into view.

			circle is base for floor and side wall, one partition in front of the camera.
			floor of room is constructed with a curve containing photo 1
